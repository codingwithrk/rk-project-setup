Basically everytime I started new [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) project I have set up lot of things like

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com/)
- [FluxUI](https://fluxui.dev/)

For FluxUI I have to change file like

- app.blade.php
- app.css

So, I decided to create this package. If you are also same like me then you can use this package in your next **Laravel** project.

## How to install

### In your laravel project

```bash
composer require codingwithrk/rk-project-setup
```

> This is ask for composer confirmation then give yes (y).
>
> That's it you it will take care rest of the installations.
